# Pictures Plugin (Roundcube)
This is a very simple pictures/gallery plugin for Roundcube. You can view your personal photos that are synced to your personal storage in a easy way. This plugin does not sync itself, it gives you only easy access to the synced photos. To sync your photos, you can use any sync software/system which can automatically sync the photos from your smartphone (or any other device) to a storage accessible by Roundcube. 

# History
This plugin is based upon MinigalNano (https://github.com/sebsauvage/MinigalNano) and extended to suite my needs to work as a plugin for Roundcube.
