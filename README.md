# Pictures Plugin (Roundcube)
This is a simple pictures/gallery plugin for Roundcube. You can view your personal photos that are synced to your personal storage in a easy way. This plugin does not sync itself, it gives you only easy access to the synced photos. To sync your photos, you can use any software/system which can automatically sync the photos from your smartphone (or any other device) to a storage accessible by Roundcube. 

I used [Justified-Gallery](https://github.com/miromannino/Justified-Gallery) to show the thumbnails on the page in a way i personally like it and [GLightbox](https://biati-digital.github.io/glightbox/) to display the pictures. Videos are integrated via [Plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr). Please see the license details on the page of this projects.
