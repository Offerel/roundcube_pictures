# Pictures Plugin (Roundcube)
This is a very simple pictures/gallery plugin for Roundcube. You can view your personal photos that are synced to your personal storage in a easy way. This plugin does not sync itself, it gives you only easy access to the synced photos. To sync your photos, you can use any sync software/system which can automatically sync the photos from your smartphone (or any other device) to a storage accessible by Roundcube. 

I used [Justified-Gallery](https://github.com/miromannino/Justified-Gallery) to show the thumbnails on the page in a way i personally like it and [lightGallery](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightGallery) to display the pictures. Please see the license details on the page of this projects.

# History
This plugin was originally based on MinigalNano (https://github.com/sebsauvage/MinigalNano), but was changed so far that there is hardly any code left from this project.
